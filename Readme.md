# MQTT2Prometheus

This exporter translates from MQTT topics to prometheus metrics. The core design is that clients send arbitrary JSON messages
 on the topics. The translation is programmed into the mqtt2prometheus since we often can not change the IoT devices sending 
 the messages. Clients can push 
metrics via MQTT to an MQTT Broker. This exporter subscribes to the broker and
publish the received messages as prometheus metrics. I wrote this exporter to publish
metrics from small embedded sensors based on the NodeMCU to prometheus. The used arduino scetch can be found in the [dht22tomqtt](https://github.com/hikhvar/dht22tomqtt) repository. A local hacking environment with mqtt2prometheus, a MQTT broker and a prometheus server is in the [hack](https://github.com/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus/tree/master/hack) directory.

## Assumptions about Messages and Topics
This exporter makes some assumptions about the MQTT topics. This exporter assumes that each
client publish the metrics into a dedicated topic. The regular expression Ã¬n the configuration field `mqtt.device_id_regex`
defines how to extract the device ID from the MQTT topic. This allow an arbitrary place of the device ID in the mqtt topic.
For example the [tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota) firmware pushes the telemetry data to the topics `tele/<deviceid>/SENSOR`.

Let us assume the default configuration from [#ConfigFile]. A sensor publishes the following message
```json
{"temperature":23.20,"humidity":51.60, "computed": {"heat_index":22.92} }
```

to the MQTT topic `devices/me/livingroom`. This message becomes the following prometheus metrics:

```text
temperature{sensor="livingroom",topic="devices/me/livingroom"} 23.2
heat_index{sensor="livingroom",topic="devices/me/livingroom"} 22.92
humidity{sensor="livingroom",topic="devices/me/livingroom"} 51.6
```

### Tasmota
An example configuration for the tasmota based Gosund SP111 device is given in [examples/gosund_sp111.yaml](examples/gosund_sp111.yaml).

## Build

To build the exporter run:

```bash
make build
```

Only the latest two Go major versions are tested and supported. 

### Docker

#### Use Public Image

To start the public available image run:
```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml"  -p  9641:9641 ghcr.io/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus:latest 
```
Please have a look at the [latest relase](https://github.com/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus/releases/latest) to get a stable image tag. The latest tag may break at any moment in time since latest is pushed into the registries on every git commit in the master branch. 

#### Build The Image locally
To build a docker container with the mqtt2prometheus exporter included run:

```bash
make container
```

To run the container with a given config file:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml"  -p 9641:9641 mqtt2prometheus:latest 
```

## Configuration
The exporter can be configured via command line and config file. 

### Commandline
Available command line flags:

```text
Usage of ./mqtt2prometheus.linux_amd64:
  -config string
    	config file (default "config.yaml")
  -listen-address string
    	listen address for HTTP server used to expose metrics (default "0.0.0.0")
  -listen-port string
    	HTTP port used to expose metrics (default "9641")
  -log-format string
    	set the desired log output format. Valid values are 'console' and 'json' (default "console")
  -log-level value
    	sets the default loglevel (default: "info")
  -version
    	show the builds version, date and commit
```
The logging is implemented via [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap). The logs are printed to `stderr` and valid log levels are
those supported by zap.  


### Config file
The config file can look like this:

```yaml
# Settings for the MQTT Client. Currently only these three are supported
mqtt:
  # The MQTT broker to connect to
  server: tcp://127.0.0.1:1883
  # Optional: Username and Password for authenticating with the MQTT Server
  # user: bob
  # password: happylittleclouds
  # Optional: for TLS client certificates
  # ca_cert: certs/AmazonRootCA1.pem
  # client_cert: certs/xxxxx-certificate.pem.crt
  # client_key: certs/xxxxx-private.pem.key
  # Optional: Used to specify ClientID. The default is <hostname>-<pid>
  # client_id: somedevice
  # The Topic path to subscribe to. Be aware that you have to specify the wildcard.
  topic_path: v1/devices/me/+
  # Optional: Regular expression to extract the device ID from the topic path. The default regular expression, assumes
  # that the last "element" of the topic_path is the device id.
  # The regular expression must contain a named capture group with the name deviceid
  # For example the expression for tasamota based sensors is "tele/(?P<deviceid>.*)/.*"
  # device_id_regex: "(.*/)?(?P<deviceid>.*)"
  # The MQTT QoS level
  qos: 0
cache:
  # Timeout. Each received metric will be presented for this time if no update is send via MQTT.
  # Set the timeout to -1 to disable the deletion of metrics from the cache. The exporter presents the ingest timestamp
  # to prometheus.
  timeout: 24h
# This is a list of valid metrics. Only metrics listed here will be exported
metrics:

    type: gauge
    # A map of string to string for constant labels. This labels will be attached to every prometheus metric

      map:
        off: 0
        low: 0
      # Metric value to use if a match cannot be found in the map above.
      # If not specified, parsing error will occur.
      error_value: 1      
```


## Best Practices
The exporter can only listen to one topic_path per instance. If you have to listen to two different topic_paths it is 
recommended to run two instances of the mqtt2prometheus exporter. You can run both on the same host or if you run in Kubernetes,
even in the same pod.
